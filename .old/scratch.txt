It is acceptable to duplicate a command at a different level of the hierarchy (ie, with a different parent). For example:
```
interface GigabitEthernet1
 description USER INTERFACE
interface GigabitEthernet2
 description USER INTERFACE
```

2. A Cisco IOS-XE "enable password" or "enable secret" should be converted to the Juniper JunOS "system root-authentication plain-text-password-value". This is a hidden command, so it may not be documented.
