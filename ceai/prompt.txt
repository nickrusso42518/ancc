Convert the {src_type} network device configuration below into {dst_type}.

```
{config_text}
```

Here are examples of equivalent configuration snippets across multiple formats so you can understand my intent. The code block below this sentence is NOT part of the configuration I'm asking you to convert as this is just an example:

```
### Cisco IOS-XE Equivalent Example ###
hostname R01
enable password labadmin123
interface Loopback0
 ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.255
 ip ospf 1 area 0
interface Ethernet0/1
 description TO R13
 ip address 10.1.13.1 255.255.255.0
 ip ospf network point-to-point
 ip ospf 1 area 3
 ip ospf cost 7
interface Ethernet0/2
 description TO BACKBONE LAN
 ip address 10.0.99.1 255.255.255.0
 ip ospf authentication
 ip ospf authentication-key OSPF1234
 ip ospf network broadcast
 ip ospf priority 0
 ip ospf 1 area 0

Provide your answer in a single text block containing the entire {dst_type} configuration. Here are the requirements for how the configuration should be converted:

## Requirements:
1. If you encounter an encrypted string (such as a password or shared secret) that uses an encryption algorithm unsupported by both {src_type} and {dst_type} formats, replace that string with the text "ENCRYPTED_STRING" so that the user can manually change it. If you are uncertain as to whether an encryption algorithm unsupported by both {src_type} and {dst_type} formats, do not guess, and use "ENCRYPTED_STRING" by default.
2. Preserve configuration element names to the best of your ability. For example, if Loopback0 exists in the {src_type} configuration, you should use Loopback0 in the {dst_type} configuration. Do not arbitrarily change it to Loopback1, for example.
3. Include the proper leading whitespace for readability, but strip all trailing whitespaces from each line.
4. Do not abbreviate any commands.
5. Do not unnecessarily duplicate identical commands at the same level of the hierarchy. For example:
```
interface GigabitEthernet1
 description USER INTERFACE
 description USER INTERFACE
```
It is acceptable to duplicate a command at a different level of the hierarchy (ie, with a different parent). For example:
```
interface GigabitEthernet1
 description USER INTERFACE
interface GigabitEthernet2
 description USER INTERFACE
```
5. If you are uncertain as to whether a command or feature is supported by both {src_type} and {dst_type} formats, or if you simply do not know how to convert a certain segment of configuration between these formats, do not guess. For example, Cisco IOS-XR does not support the PIM dense-mode feature. If converting from Cisco IOS-XE to Cisco IOS-XR, you should instead retain the source configuration prepended with a # character within the destination configuration. For example:

```
*** Cisco IOS-XE Example ***
interface GigabitEthernet1
 ip address 192.0.2.1 255.255.255.0
 ip pim dense-mode

*** Cisco IOS-XR Example ***
interface GigabitEthernet1
 ipv4 address 192.0.2.1 255.255.255.0
 # ip pim dense-mode
```
6. Pay extra attention to interface conversions. Ensure that IP addressing and routing protocol enablement are mapped to the correct interfaces. Never duplicate IP addresses or routing protocol enablement on the same interface.

## Platform-specific details:
1. Interface names may change between platforms. Follow these guidelines when converting:
  a. Cisco IOS-XE "Ethernet" interfaces turn into Juniper Junos "em" interfaces, and vice versa.
  b. Cisco IOS-XE "GigabitEthernet" interfaces turn into Juniper Junos "ge" interfaces, and vice versa.
  c. Cisco IOS-XE "TenGigabitEthernet" interfaces turn into Juniper Junos "xe" interfaces, and vice versa.
  d. Cisco IOS-XE "HundredGigabitEthernet" interfaces turn into Juniper Junos "et" interfaces, and vice versa.

2. A Cisco IOS-XE "enable password" or "enable secret" should be interpreted as the Juniper JunOS "system root-authentication" password, and vice versa.
