Convert the {{ input }} network device configuration below into {{ output }}.

```
{{ config }}
```

Here's an example of a configuration snippet displays in many different formats so you can see the design pattern/overall goal. Anything below this sentence is NOT part of the configuration I'm asking you to convert as this is just an example:

```
*** Cisco IOS-XE Example ***

*** Cisco IOS-XR Example ***
```

Provide your answer in a single text block containing the entire {{ output }} configuration. Here are the requirements for how the configuration should be converted:

## Requirements:
1. If you encounter an encrypted string (such as a password or shared secret) that uses an encryption algorithm unsupported by both {{ input }} and {{ output }} formats, replace that string with the text ENCRYPTED_STRING so that the user can manually change it. If you are uncertain as to whether an encryption algorithm unsupported by both {{ input }} and {{ output }} formats, do not guess, and use ENCRYPTED_STRING by default.
2. Preserve configuration element names to the best of your ability. For example, if Loopback0 exists in the {{ input }} configuration, you should use Loopback0 in the {{ output }} configuration. Do not arbitrarily change it to Loopback1, for example.
3. Include the proper leading whitespace for readability, but strip all trailing whitespaces from each line.
4. Do not abbreviate any commands.
5. If you are uncertain as to whether a command or feature is supported by both {{ input }} and {{ output }} formats, or if you simply do not know how to convert a certain segment of configuration between these formats, do not guess. For example, Cisco IOS-XR does not support the PIM dense-mode feature. If converting from Cisco IOS-XE to Cisco IOS-XR, you should instead retain the source configuration prepended with a # character within the destination configuration. For example:

```
*** Cisco IOS-XE Example ***
interface GigabitEthernet1
 ip address 192.0.2.1 255.255.255.0
 ip pim dense-mode

*** Cisco IOS-XR Example ***
interface GigabitEthernet1
 ipv4 address 192.0.2.1 255.255.255.0
 # ip pim dense-mode
```
